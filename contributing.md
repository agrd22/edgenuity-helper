## Basic guidelines

All pull-requests should:
- Be working
- Be tested
- Be ready for production
- Have all commits contain insightful descriptions

## How to create a pull-request

- Create a local fork of the repo
- Create a new branch on that fork using `git checkout -b fork_name`
  - Create and make changes on your local fork
  - Commit those changes with insightful messages
- Push the changes from the new branch to your local fork using `git push -u origin fork_name`
- Create a pull-request from Github
